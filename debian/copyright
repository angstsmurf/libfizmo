License: public-domain
 Unlimited copying and redistribution of this file
 is permitted so long as the file is not modified
 in any way.
 Modifications may be made for private purposes (though
 this is discouraged, as it could result in documents
 hyphenating differently on different systems) but if
 such modifications are re-distributed, the modified
 file must not be capable of being confused with the
 original.  In particular, this means
 (a) the filename (the portion before the extension, if any)
   must not match any of :
        UKHYPH                  UK-HYPH
        UKHYPHEN                UK-HYPHEN
        UKHYPHENS               UK-HYPHENS
        UKHYPHENATION           UK-HYPHENATION
        UKHYPHENISATION         UK-HYPHENISATION
        UKHYPHENIZATION         UK-HYPHENIZATION
   regardless of case, and
 (b) the file must contain conditions identical to these,
 except that the modifier/distributor may, if he or she
 wishes, augment the list of proscribed filenames.
